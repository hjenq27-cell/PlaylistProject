# Playlist Project


## Description

For this project, you and up to two partners (if you like!) will work on creating a series of files designed to mimic a playlist of songs much like a Spotify or iTunes playlist. As part of practicing with GitHub, your submission will be a link to your GitHub repository. **To receive full credit, your project must have a history of at least 5 commits with included messages**. All partners must submit at least one commit.

A series of “starter” files is available for you to use—if you would like to approach the project differently, that is up to you!

To make life easier, your tester program should not include any opportunity for user input—instead all of your tester implementation will be hard-coded and printed out to show viability. This means that you should **not make a `Scanner`** for your project.

The `Playlist` object should contain a collection of `Song` objects—each `Song` should have a title, artist, duration and status of whether the song is “liked” associated with it.

The `Playlist` should demonstrate the following functionality:

- adding a song to the playlist
- “liking” a song in a playlist
- removing a song from a playlist
- examining all songs in the playlist
- examining a sublist of just the “liked” songs
- determining the total duration of the playlist
- removing all “unliked” songs in a playlist with a single method—be careful when removing elements from a list (what is a common bug with removing from a list?)

The `PlaylistTester` file should include a demonstration of each of these methods that the `Playlist` has.
